Here are some information that may help you to use the App.

### The App is empty. Refreshing doesn't work.

- First, go to `Change current semester` in `Settings` to make sure you have selected the correct semester you want. Summer semesters sometimes make the App blank since there may be no courses.
- Please Try to `Logout` in `Settings` and re-login.
- Change to campus networks. The connections are sometimes broken if you are connected to off-campus networks.

### iOS: The file won't open. / The file is always blank.

- This is possibly due to any download failure. Please use `Clear file cache` in `Settings` to clear file cache. The App will try to download the file again.
- Please also check the file format. Some formats are not supported on iOS WebView, such as `.zip`, `.rar` and so on. Please tap the `share` button on the upper right the screen to share the file to other apps that support these formats.

### Android: Tapping on the file doesn't do anything.

- This is possibly due to any download failure. Please use `Clear file cache` in `Settings` to clear file cache. The App will try to download the file again.
- Please also check the file size. It takes longer to download large files and there is possibility that the download will fail.

### iOS: There are multiple calendar events in my Calendar.

- This is a known issue.
- Please go to Calendar and tap `Calendars` on the bottom. Tap the information icon on the right of `learnX` calendar. Scroll down and you can delete this calendar. You can first delete all `learnX` calendar and go back to the App to refresh the `Assignment` screen. The App will then write current assignment deadlines into Calendar.
- If you cannot delete the calendar, please create a new dummy calendar and then delete the `learnX` calendar. You can delete the dummy calendar after the `learnX` calendar is recreated by the App.
